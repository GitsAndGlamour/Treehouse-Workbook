  	<!-- Note on Using jQuery with a CDN:
- CDNs can offer a performance benefit by hosting jQuery on servers spread
- across the globe. This also offers an advantage that if the visitor to your
- webpage has already downloaded a copy of jQuery from the same CDN, it won't
- have to be re-downloaded. (http://jquery.com/download/) -->
